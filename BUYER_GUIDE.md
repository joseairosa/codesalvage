---

## Understanding Escrow

### What is Escrow?

**Escrow = Buyer Protection**:

- When you purchase, payment is held for **7 days**
- During this time:
  - You receive code immediately
  - You can review and test the code
  - Seller does NOT receive payment yet
- After 7 days:
  - If no issues, seller receives payment automatically
  - If you opened a dispute, we review and resolve

### 7-Day Review Period

**What to Check**:

- [ ] Code downloads and extracts successfully
- [ ] Project matches description
- [ ] Completion % is accurate
- [ ] Major features work as described
- [ ] No critical bugs that prevent use
- [ ] Documentation is adequate (if promised)

**Common Misconceptions**:

- ❌ Code must be 100% perfect (NO - you bought unfinished code)
- ❌ All bugs must be fixed (NO - known issues were disclosed)
- ✅ Code must match the description (YES)
- ✅ Major features must work (YES)
- ✅ Completion % must be accurate (YES)

### Opening a Dispute

**Valid Reasons**:

- Project doesn't match description
- Completion % significantly inflated (80% claimed, actually 40%)
- Major features don't work or are missing
- Code cannot be run (missing critical files)
- Seller misrepresented what was included

**Invalid Reasons**:

- Code has bugs (bugs were expected and disclosed)
- You can't figure out how to set it up (ask seller for help first)
- You changed your mind (all sales final unless description mismatch)
- You want different tech stack (that was disclosed upfront)

**How to Dispute**:

1. Navigate to transaction at `/buyer/purchases/[transaction-id]`
2. Click "Open Dispute" button (only available in 7-day window)
3. Select reason for dispute
4. Provide evidence:
   - Screenshots of issues
   - Specific description mismatches
   - Error messages
5. Submit dispute

**Resolution Process**:

- Platform reviews both sides (usually 2-3 business days)
- We check: Description, code, messages, evidence
- Possible outcomes:
  - **Full refund**: Description significantly mismatched
  - **Partial refund**: Minor issues but mostly as described
  - **No refund**: Project matches description, buyer error
- Decision is final

**Avoiding Disputes**:

- Read description thoroughly before purchase
- Ask questions before buying
- Understand you're buying **unfinished** code
- Check completion % and known issues
- Message seller if you need clarification

**Review Tips**:

**Be Specific**:

- ✅ "Well-structured React codebase with clear component organization. Authentication module worked perfectly out of the box."

**Be Fair**:

- Remember: You bought **unfinished** code
- Don't penalize for disclosed known issues
- Rate based on description accuracy and code quality
- Consider seller's responsiveness to questions

**Be Constructive**:

- If rating low, explain why
- Suggest improvements

**Example Reviews**:

**5 Stars**:

> "Excellent starting point for my SaaS project. 75% completion was accurate. Code is clean and well-commented. Seller responded to my setup questions within hours. Would buy from again."

**3 Stars**:

> "Project was closer to 60% complete than the 80% advertised. Code quality is good but documentation was sparse. Took me longer to set up than expected. Seller did help when I messaged, just needed more upfront info."

**1 Star**:

> "Project description said authentication was 'fully functional' but critical password reset flow was completely missing. This is a major feature, not a minor bug. Seller didn't respond to my messages."

### After You Submit
