**Security Measures**:
- ✅ Payments processed by Stripe (industry standard)
- ✅ 7-day escrow protection for buyers
- ✅ Seller verification for Pro accounts
- ✅ Dispute resolution system

---

## For Buyers

### What am I actually buying?

**You're buying:**
- ✅ Source code for an unfinished project
- ✅ A head start on development
- ✅ Time savings vs. building from scratch

**You're NOT buying:**
- ❌ A finished, production-ready product
- ❌ Ongoing support or maintenance
- ❌ Guaranteed bug-free code
- ❌ Hosting or deployment services

**Important**: Completion % tells you how much is done. If a project is 70% complete, you'll need to finish the remaining 30% yourself.

---

### How do I know if a project is good quality?

**Quality Indicators**:

**✅ Good Signs**:
- Seller has Pro verified badge
- High seller rating (4+ stars)
- Multiple positive reviews
- Detailed description including known issues
- High-quality screenshots or demo video
- Public GitHub repository (preview code quality)
- Live demo available
- Seller responds to messages quickly

**❌ Red Flags**:
- No screenshots or only placeholder images
- Vague description with no technical details
- Seller has no reviews or low rating
- Price way below similar projects
- No response to pre-purchase messages
- Completion % seems inflated vs. description

**Best Practice**: Message seller with technical questions before purchasing. Responsive, knowledgeable answers = quality seller.

---

### Can I get a refund?

**Yes, under certain conditions.**

**7-Day Escrow Period** (Buyer Protection):
- You have **7 days** to review the code after purchase
- If project doesn't match description, open a dispute
- Valid reasons for refund:
  - ✅ Project significantly incomplete vs. description
  - ✅ Major features missing or non-functional
  - ✅ Code cannot be run (missing critical files)
  - ✅ Completion % significantly inflated

**Invalid Reasons**:
- ❌ You changed your mind
- ❌ Code has bugs (unfinished code is expected to have bugs)
- ❌ You can't figure out how to set it up (ask seller for help)
- ❌ You want a different tech stack (that was disclosed)

**After 7 Days**: Escrow released, refunds not possible (except fraud cases).

**Refund Process**:
1. Open dispute with evidence (screenshots, details)
2. Platform reviews (2-3 business days)
3. Decision: Full refund, partial refund, or no refund
4. Funds returned to original payment method if approved

---

### What is the escrow period?

**Escrow = Payment held for 7 days.**

**How It Works**:
1. You purchase a project
2. Payment is held by platform (not sent to seller yet)
3. You receive code immediately
4. You have **7 days** to review and test code
5. After 7 days (if no issues), seller receives payment

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Buyer protection against fraud or misrepresentation
- ✅ Time to verify code matches description
- ✅ Ability to dispute if significant issues found
- ✅ Incentivizes sellers to be honest and accurate

**What to Do in 7 Days**:
- Download and extract code
- Install dependencies and run project
- Test major features
- Verify completion % is accurate
- Open dispute if issues found (do this EARLY, not on day 7)

---

### Can I see the code before buying?

**Sometimes.**

**GitHub Preview** (if seller provides):
- Some sellers link public GitHub repos
- You can preview code quality, structure, commits
- Most valuable for evaluating before purchase

**Live Demo** (if seller provides):
- Test actual functionality
- See project in action
- Better than screenshots for understanding features

**Screenshots & Videos**:
- All projects have screenshots
- Many have demo videos
- Shows UI and features but not underlying code

**If No Preview**:
- Message seller asking for GitHub access or demo
- Check seller rating and reviews
- Understand there's more risk (use escrow period wisely)

**After Purchase**:
- You receive full code immediately (ZIP download or GitHub access)
- 7-day escrow period to review

---

### What if the code doesn't work?

**Within 7-Day Escrow Period**:

**First**: Message seller with specific error messages
- Many setup issues have quick fixes
- Seller may provide workarounds
- Could be environment mismatch (Node.js version, etc.)

**If Seller Can't Help**: Open a dispute
- Document issues with screenshots
- Provide error messages
- Explain what doesn't work vs. description
- Platform reviews and decides on refund

**After 7 Days**:
- Escrow released, refunds not available
- Seller may still help if you message politely
- Leave honest review to warn other buyers

**Common Setup Issues** (not refund-worthy):
- Missing environment variables (.env file)
- Wrong Node.js/Python version
- Dependencies not installed
- Database not configured

**Actual Misrepresentation** (refund-worthy):
- Core features don't exist
- Code is fundamentally broken
- Project is 30% complete when advertised as 80%

---

### Can I resell a project I purchase?

**Check the license type** specified by seller.

**Common License Types**:

1. **Full Code Transfer** (most common)
   - You own all rights after purchase
   - ✅ Can use commercially
   - ✅ Can modify
   - ✅ Can resell
   - ✅ Can integrate into your products

2. **Limited License**
   - You can use but cannot resell as-is
   - ✅ Can use commercially
   - ✅ Can modify
   - ❌ Cannot resell original code
   - ✅ Can sell derivative products built on top

3. **Custom License**
   - Read seller's specific terms
   - Varies by project

**Best Practice**: Clarify licensing with seller before purchasing if you plan to resell.

---

## For Sellers

### How much does it cost to sell?

**No Upfront Fees**:
- ✅ Free to create account
- ✅ Free to list up to 3 projects (Free tier)
- ✅ No monthly fees (unless Pro subscription)

**Commission on Sales**:
- **18% platform commission** on each sale
- Example: $500 project → You receive $410 after $90 commission

- **Platform Commission**: $90 (18%)
- **You Receive**: $395.20

**Pro Subscription** (Optional):
- $9.99/month for unlimited listings and benefits
- See [What is the Pro subscription?](#what-is-the-pro-subscription)

---

### When do I get paid?

**7-Day Escrow Period**:
- Payment is held for 7 days after sale
- Buyer protection period
- If no disputes, funds released automatically

**Payout Schedule**:
- **Automatic**: Weekly (every Monday if balance > $50)
- **Manual**: Request payout anytime (minimum $50 balance)
- First payout may take 7-10 business days (Stripe verification)

**Setup Required**:
- Connect Stripe account (one-time setup)
- Provide tax information (W-9 for US, W-8BEN international)
- Link bank account for payouts

**Total Wait Time**:
- 7 days (escrow) + up to 7 days (payout schedule) = ~2 weeks from sale to bank account

---

### How many projects can I list?

**Free Tier**:
- Maximum **3 active projects** at once
- Unlimited drafts (unpublished)
- Unlimited sold projects (archived)

**Pro Tier** ($9.99/month):
- **Unlimited active projects**
- No restrictions on published listings

**What Counts as "Active"**:
- ✅ Published and visible in search
- ❌ Drafts (not yet published)
- ❌ Sold projects (automatically archived)
- ❌ Delisted projects (hidden but not deleted)

**Reaching the Limit**:
- You'll see warning when approaching 3 projects
- Must delist or delete a project before publishing a new one
- OR upgrade to Pro for unlimited

---

### What completion percentage should I use?

**Be Honest**:
- Accurate completion % builds trust
- Inflated % leads to disputes and bad reviews
- Buyers appreciate transparency

**Guidelines**:

- **10-30%**: Basic structure and core features started
  - Example: Authentication framework set up, few pages completed

- **30-50%**: Core features working, many supporting features missing
  - Example: User management works, but dashboard and reporting not started

- **50-70%**: Most major features present, needs refinement and polish
  - Example: All CRUD operations work, but UI needs work and tests missing

- **70-90%**: Feature-complete, needs testing, bug fixes, and finishing touches
  - Example: All features built, minor bugs present, documentation incomplete

- **90-100%**: Nearly complete, only minor fixes or deployment remaining
  - Example: Fully functional, good documentation, just needs hosting setup

**Consider**:
- What's built vs. what was originally planned
- Code quality (well-structured code = higher %)
- Documentation (good docs increase effective completion)
- Tests (test coverage adds to completion)

**Example Descriptions**:

**60% Complete**:
> "Core functionality complete: user authentication, dashboard, basic CRUD operations. Remaining: advanced reporting, email notifications, payment integration (estimated 20-25 hours)."

**85% Complete**:
> "Fully functional with all planned features. Needs: minor bug fixes, test coverage improvement, deployment documentation (estimated 5-10 hours)."

---

### Can I sell the same project to multiple buyers?

**Yes, absolutely.**

**Digital Goods**:
- Code can be sold unlimited times
- Each buyer receives full code
- No exclusivity unless you specify

**Exclusivity Options**:
- Default: Non-exclusive (can sell to multiple buyers)
- Optional: Offer exclusive rights for higher price
- Specify in listing description if exclusive

**Ethical Considerations**:
- ✅ Always ethical to sell multiple copies (standard practice)
- ✅ Buyers understand code isn't exclusive unless stated
- ❌ Don't promise exclusivity if you plan to sell to others
- ✅ Consider removing listing after first sale if you want exclusivity

**Pricing Strategy**:
- Non-exclusive: Standard pricing ($100-$1,000+)
- Exclusive rights: 3-5x higher price (compensates for lost future sales)

---

### What if a buyer disputes?

**Dispute Process**:

1. **Buyer Opens Dispute** (within 7-day escrow period)
   - Must provide reason and evidence
   - You receive email notification

2. **You Respond** (within 24-48 hours)
   - Provide counter-evidence
   - Screenshots, original listing description, messages
   - Explain your side professionally

3. **Platform Reviews** (2-3 business days)
   - We review both sides
   - Check: Description accuracy, code quality, evidence
   - Decision: Full refund, partial refund, or no refund

4. **Decision Final**
   - Both parties notified
   - Funds released or refunded based on decision
   - Outcome affects seller rating if refund issued

**Common Dispute Reasons**:

**Valid** (may result in refund):
- Description significantly mismatched
- Completion % vastly inflated
- Major features missing vs. description
- Critical files missing (code doesn't run)

**Invalid** (unlikely to refund):
- Buyer can't set up project (their responsibility)
- Minor bugs in unfinished code (expected)
- Buyer changed their mind (all sales final)
- Features were disclosed in "known issues"

**Protecting Yourself**:
- ✅ Write accurate, detailed descriptions
- ✅ List known issues upfront
- ✅ Specify completion % honestly
- ✅ Respond to pre-sale questions thoroughly
- ✅ Save all messages with buyer
- ✅ Provide setup instructions with code

**Dispute Resolution Tips**:
- Stay professional (don't be defensive)
