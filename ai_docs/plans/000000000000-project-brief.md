# PROJECT BRIEF: ProjectFinish - Incomplete Projects Marketplace

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Platform Name:** ProjectFinish (or similar - ProjectSwap, CodeFinish, HalfBaked)

**Core Concept:** A specialized marketplace connecting developers who have incomplete projects (50-95% done) with developers/entrepreneurs who want to purchase and complete them. The unique value proposition is **completion percentage transparency** and solving the "Last 5% Problem" — where the final polish takes 80% of the total project timeline.

**Problem Solved:**

- Developers have dozens of unfinished side projects collecting dust
- Building from scratch is time-consuming; 80% of a project takes 20% of effort, 20% takes 80%
- No existing marketplace specifically for incomplete projects with transparent completion status
- Buyers want to launch quickly without coding from zero

**Target Market:**

- **Sellers:** Indie developers, full-time devs with side projects, startup founders with failed MVPs, students, teams
- **Buyers:** Indie hackers, freelancers, small agencies, aspiring entrepreneurs, bootstrapped startups

**Revenue Model:**

- 15-20% platform commission per transaction
- Premium seller features ($9.99/month): unlimited listings, analytics, featured placements
- Enterprise tier: Team management, API access, custom integrations

**MVP Timeline:** 8-12 weeks to full MVP launch

## 2. BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

### Primary Goals (Year 1)

2. Process **500+ project listings** by end of Year 1
3. Achieve **$100,000-$150,000 annual revenue** (conservative to optimistic)
4. Establish **market authority** as the go-to platform for this use case
5. Generate **social proof** through early user wins and testimonials

## 3. MARKET RESEARCH FINDINGS

### The Problem (Validated)

- **Pareto Principle in Development:** 20% of code effort produces 80% of results; remaining 80% of effort focuses on the final 20% of features/polish
- **Real Market Evidence:** DevSwapSell (2025 alpha) already validating this exact use case with early traction
- **Developer Reality:** Indie developers average 20-30 unfinished projects in their repositories
- **Time Investment:** Last 5% of a project (testing, documentation, deployment, bug fixes) frequently takes longer than initial 95%

### Competitive Landscape

| Platform                | Focus                   | Commission | Limitation                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Envato (CodeCanyon)     | Finished code/scripts   | 12.5-37.5% | Generic code marketplace, not project-focused     |
| Gumroad                 | Digital products        | 10%        | Not developer/code-specific, no code preview      |
| GitHub Marketplace      | Tools/extensions        | Variable   | For finished products, limited project sales      |
| **ProjectFinish (You)** | **Incomplete projects** | **15-20%** | **Transparent completion %, tech-stack filtered** |

### Market Gap

**No dominant player specifically serves incomplete projects with completion % transparency.** This is your competitive moat.

8. Seller dashboard with analytics
9. Buyer dashboard with purchase history
10. Core profile pages (seller, buyer)

Tech stack:
- Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- PostgreSQL database
- Stripe for payments
- GitHub OAuth
- Tailwind CSS
- TanStack Query for state management
- SendGrid for emails

Start with the database schema and then build the core features in order.
I want to test this as a working prototype within 4 weeks.

## APPENDIX B: GLOSSARY

**Completion %** - Estimated percentage of project development finished (0-100%). A 75% project might have core features done but needs testing, documentation, bug fixes.

**Escrow** - Holding buyer's payment for 7 days to ensure seller delivered promised code and buyer can access it properly.

**The Last 5% Problem** - The phenomenon where final 5% of features/polish takes disproportionate time (Pareto Principle: 20% of effort = 80% of results; 80% of effort = 20% of results).

**Tech Stack** - Programming languages, frameworks, databases used in a project (React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, etc.).

**License Type** - How buyer can use the code: "Full Code" = own it completely, "Limited License" = can use but can't resell, "Custom" = negotiated terms.

**MVP** - Minimum Viable Product; the core features needed to test market fit before adding advanced features.

**SaaS** - Software as a Service; subscription-based software model (not applicable here; ProjectFinish uses one-time sales + premium subscriptions for sellers).
