# PROJECTFINISH - BUSINESS PLAN & TECHNICAL OVERVIEW

## EXECUTIVE BRIEF FOR INVESTORS/STAKEHOLDERS

### The Idea in One Sentence

A marketplace for developers to sell and buy incomplete software projects (50-95% done), uniquely focused on solving the "Last 5% Problem" where final polish takes disproportionate time.

### The Problem (Validated Market Gap)

**Developer Reality:**

- Indie developers have 20-30+ incomplete projects in their repositories
- 80% of project work takes 20% of development time (Pareto Principle)
- Final 5% of project (testing, documentation, polish) takes longer than initial 95%
- Developers often abandon projects due to motivation loss or lack of time

**Business Reality:**

- No existing marketplace specifically for INCOMPLETE projects
- Current marketplaces (Envato, Gumroad) focus on finished products/code
- Entrepreneurs want to launch quickly without building from zero
- Gap between "95% done" and "ready to ship" is huge opportunity

### Market Evidence

**Real Platform Launch:** DevSwapSell (2025 alpha) already validating exact use case with early developer traction

**Market Size:**

- 28 million developers globally (Stack Overflow 2024)
- Estimated 60-70% have 10+ unfinished projects
- Estimated serviceable market: 5-10 million developers
- At $1,000 avg transaction value = $5-10B TAM

**Buyer Pool:**

- Indie hackers: 1M+ globally
- Freelancers: 73M globally looking for quick revenue
- Small agencies: 500K+ looking for code to resell

### Why Now?

1. **AI is creating explosion of unfinished projects** - ChatGPT/Claude enables rapid prototyping, leaving more incomplete experiments
2. **Developer community maturation** - Open to buying/selling code, normalizing developer commerce
3. **Technical infrastructure ready** - Stripe Connect, GitHub API, cloud deployment make seamless transactions possible
4. **Pareto Principle awareness** - Developers increasingly understand/accept "last 5% is 80% of work"

## BUSINESS MODEL

### Revenue Streams (Year 1 Prioritized)

#### 1. Platform Commission (PRIMARY)

- **Model:** 15-20% per transaction (benchmarked against Envato 12.5-37.5%)
- **Reasoning:**
  - Lower than Envato (attract sellers away)
  - Higher than Gumroad (specialized service justifies premium)
  - Aligns incentives: platform gains from larger sales
- **Scale:** 30-50 transactions/month by month 12 = $4,500-9,000 MRR

#### 2. Premium Seller Features (SECONDARY)

## UNIT ECONOMICS

### Per-Transaction Analysis

**Average Project Sale:**

- Project price: $1,000
- Platform commission (18%): $180
- Stripe fees (2.9% + 30¢): $29
- **Net to platform:** $151/transaction

**Per-transaction profit:** $151 - $44.50 = **$106.50**

### LTV Analysis (Repeat Sellers)

**Conservative Seller Lifetime:**

- Average transactions per seller (first 12 months): 1.5
- LTV per seller = 1.5 × $180 = $270

**CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):**

- Year 1 Marketing spend: $18,000
- New sellers acquired (Year 1): 500
- **CAC: $36**

**LTV:CAC ratio:** $310:$36 = **8.6:1** (Excellent, >3:1 is healthy)
